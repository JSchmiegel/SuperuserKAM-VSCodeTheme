# SuperuserKAM - VS Code Theme

![kam_superuser header](assets/Header.gif)

This Color Theme was original only a [terminal theme](https://github.com/JSchmiegel/ColorSchemeSuperuserKAM) to match with the `SuperuserKAM` keycap design by [FreshFromTheGrave](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=108326.0%3Futm_source%3Dkeycapsets). Due to the fact, that VS Code is currently my main IDE, I wanted the theme not only in my terminal but also adopted it for VS Code.
